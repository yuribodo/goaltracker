## Installation

Before you start, ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. 

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuribodo/goaltracker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository**:

   ```bash
   cd goaltracker
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

     ```bash
     cd Front && npm install
     ```

   - For Backend:

     ```bash
     cd Back && npm install
     ```

## Running the Application

- **To run the frontend**:

  ```bash
  cd Front
  npm run dev
  ```

  This starts the React application on `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port).

- **To run the backend**:

  ```bash
  cd Back
  npm run dev
  ```

  This initializes the Express server, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

Ensure that the frontend and backend are configured to run on separate ports to avoid conflicts.
